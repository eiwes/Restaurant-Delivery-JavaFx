# Restaurant-Delivery-JavaFx

The application uses [commited earlier Oracle Database](https://github.com/eiwes/database-restaurant).

Easy and fun to use. Very user friendly interface with simple features.

**Customer Page** is as simple as possible. The user has the ability to make an order seeing through all of the dishes available at the menu.

**Login Page** is one for administrator and users. Depending on the privileges it checks whether a person has the ability to use the Administrator Dashboard or Customer's Dashboard.

**Registration** is made for Customers only. There customer enters all of the needed information, which later can be used to login into the system.
